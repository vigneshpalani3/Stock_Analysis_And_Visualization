# Data-Driven Stock Analysis: Organizing, Cleaning, and Visualizing Market Trends

## Overview

This project aims to provide a comprehensive visualization and analysis of the Nifty 50 stocks' performance over the past year. [cite: 2] It involves extracting data from YAML files, transforming it into CSV format, and developing interactive dashboards using Streamlit and Power BI. [cite: 5, 10, 11] The project analyzes daily stock data (open, close, high, low, and volume) to generate key performance insights and visualize top-performing stocks, average stock metrics, and volatility. [cite: 3, 4] This solution is designed to help investors, analysts, and enthusiasts make informed decisions based on stock performance trends. [cite: 5]

## Skills Showcase

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

* Pandas
* Python
* Power BI
* Streamlit
* SQL
* Statistics
* Data Organizing
* Data Cleaning
* Data Visualizing [cite: 1]

## Use Cases

* **Stock Performance Ranking:** Identifies the top 10 best-performing (green) and worst-performing (red) stocks over the past year. [cite: 6]
* **Market Overview:** Provides an overall market summary with average stock performance and insights into the percentage of green vs. red stocks. [cite: 7]
* **Investment Insights:** Helps investors quickly identify stocks with consistent growth or significant declines. [cite: 8]
* **Decision Support:** Offers insights into average prices, volatility, and overall stock behavior for traders. [cite: 9]

## Approach

1.  **Data Extraction and Transformation:**
    * Data is extracted from YAML files, organized by months, with date-wise entries in each month's folder. [cite: 10, 11]
    * The data is transformed into CSV format, with one CSV file per stock symbol, resulting in 50 CSV files. [cite: 11]

2.  **Data Analysis and Visualization:**
    * Key metrics are calculated using Python DataFrames. [cite: 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 23, 24, 26, 27, 28, 29, 32, 33, 34, 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]
    * Visualizations are created to represent stock performance, volatility, and sector-wise analysis. [cite: 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 24, 25, 30, 31, 36, 37]

    * **Key Analyses and Visualizations:**
        * Top 10 Green Stocks and Top 10 Loss Stocks (based on yearly return) [cite: 11]
        * Market Summary (green vs. red stocks count, average price, average volume) [cite: 11, 12]
        * Volatility Analysis (standard deviation of daily returns) [cite: 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19]
        * Cumulative Return Over Time (for top 5 performing stocks) [cite: 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25]
        * Sector-wise Performance (average yearly return by sector) [cite: 26, 27, 28, 29, 30, 31]
        * Stock Price Correlation (heatmap of correlation matrix) [cite: 32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 37]
        * Monthly Gainers and Losers (top 5 each month) [cite: 38, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43]
